## Idea One - Most diverse Playlist

Clustering on 'Diversity' of a playlist

> High frequent streams playlist —> monetize for explorers then based on NLP topic over tokens

(148 / 3.5) = n_tracks = 42 tracks, with this threshold, we still have 291K+ rows, which is enough



for Ads pushing and recommendation



### Features



[] filter off streams = 0, we need active playlist



#### Advanced

could build an classification engine on new playlist



## Idea Two - High Engaging Playlist

Features for engaging



### Features



[] run `describe()` to get basic stats





## Study on SpotifyBrands [https://spotifyforbrands.com/us/](https://spotifyforbrands.com/us/)

> # "YOU ARE WHAT YOU STREAM"

**148 min**



(148 / 3.5) = n_tracks = 42 tracks



average cross-platform user spends listening, dancing or singing along to Spotify every day.

**Spotify internal data, global free users, January 2015**

> use this as benchmark for analysis, define 'success'



Active Trend

MOBILE INCREASING TREND

New Streaming Habits:

- Discovery
- Diversity
- Tilt

Reliables vs Explorers

> This could be an k-Mean Clustering

> So with our analysis, High Skips doesn't mean its bad for `Explorers`



## Ideas

### Key Flaws of the dataset to produce the result defining `successful`

Either we assume the audience/users are from the same/or similar demographic groups who are sharing similar tastse or "spotify behavior/spotify streaming habits"









## Todos

1. Review Edward Chen's [Answers on AB testing](https://www.quora.com/When-should-A-B-testing-not-be-trusted-to-make-decisions)
2. Ask Grace to add additional 30min, to ask a team member present/talk one of the ongoing project - full lifecycle, it's a two way selection `DONE`
3. Key metrics in Music Stream Industry


like soundcloud stats
